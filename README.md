# Building an OS from Scratch: A Beginner's Journey

## Description

Welcome to my ambitious hobby project where I embark on the exciting journey of building an operating system from scratch! With little to no prior knowledge of low-level programming languages, this project is as much about learning and discovery as it is about creation.

### Objectives

1. **Learn and Understand**: Gain a foundational understanding of low-level programming concepts, system architecture, and the intricate workings of an operating system.
2. **Build**: Step-by-step development of a basic operating system, starting from the bootloader to a simple command-line interface.
3. **Document**: Share the learning process, challenges, and solutions encountered along the way.

### Journey Highlights

- **Initial Research**: Gathering resources, reading materials, and tutorials to get a grasp of the basics.
- **Setting Up the Environment**: Installing necessary tools and setting up a development environment.
- **Writing the Bootloader**: Creating the initial code to boot the system and understand the boot process.
- **Kernel Development**: Building a simple kernel to manage basic tasks and system calls.
- **Exploring Hardware Interaction**: Learning how the OS interacts with hardware components.
- **Creating a Shell**: Developing a basic command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Iteratively testing and debugging to ensure stability and functionality.

### Tools and Languages

- **Assembly Language**: For writing the bootloader and low-level hardware interactions.
- **C Language**: For kernel development and higher-level OS functionalities.
- **Development Tools**: GCC, QEMU, GDB,nasm, and other essential tools for OS development.

### Why This Project?

This project is a personal challenge to dive deep into the world of low-level programming and system design. By documenting this journey, I hope to create a resource for other beginners who might be interested in OS development but feel intimidated by the complexity. It's a testament to the idea that with curiosity, persistence, and the right resources, anyone can learn to build something as complex as an operating system.

### Join the Journey

Follow along as I document each step, share insights, and reflect on the progress. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a curious beginner, I hope this journey inspires you to take on your own challenging projects and explore the depths of computer science.
